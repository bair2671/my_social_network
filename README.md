# my_social_network
A social network application developed by me during the first semester of second year of faculty

A user can log in or create a new account. After that, he views his friends list and can delete a friend or send a message to one of them. 
The user can also view a list of users who are not friends with him and send friend requests to them. He can send messages to them too. 
Also, he can search for users, whether they are friends or not.

The application has 6 secondary menus:
1. Cereri de prietenie (Friend requests) - the user views all friend requests, both received and sent. He can accept, reject or unsend requests. 
2. Mesaje (Messages) - initially, the user views received messages, but he can also see sent messages.
3. Evenimente (Events) - a list of events the user signed up for appears. He can turn off notifications for an event or remove him from one.
Also, can join an other event or create a new one.
4. Notificari (Notifications) - the user sees notifications from events he signed up for.
5. Raport activitate (Activity report) - it can generate a user's friendships and received messages report for a given period. The report can be saved as PDF.
6. Raport mesaje (Messages report) - it generates a report of messages received from a selected user during a given period. The report can also be saved as PDF.
